## Q: How do you ensure that you have current and correct contact information for Subscribers?



SHECA take the following practices to ensure the accuracy of contact information for subscribers:

- Verification at Sign-Up: SHECA ensures that the contact information provided by a subscriber is correct at the time of their subscription, by sending a random verification code to the email address or phone number provided. Verification is also required during other business processes such as certificate renewal and rekey.
- Control Panel: Subscribers are encouraged to update their contact information regularly. Subscribers are able to update the contact details associated with their Certificate Requests by using the appropriate control panel. 
- Periodic Reminder: SHECA will periodically send reminders through email, SMS, or in-app notifications, asking subscribers to confirm or update their contact information. If communication sent to a subscriber's contact information bounces back, SHECA takes steps to contact the subscriber through alternate means to obtain the current information.
- Account Activity Monitoring: SHECA's customer service department is responsible for monitoring subscribers' account activity. If a subscriber has not logged in or interacted with the service for an extended period, SHECA's business system requires the subscriber to verify the reserved information. 

The process of collecting and storing subscribers' contact information complies with applicable privacy laws and regulations such as PIPL.

Sales managers maintain close contact with respective subscribers, ensuring a continuous flow of communication. By actively gathering feedback and making necessary adjustments, SHECA effectively mitigates compliance issues and preemptively addresses potential customer complaints arising from these changes.
