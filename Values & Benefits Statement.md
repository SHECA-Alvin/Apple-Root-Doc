SHECA has implemented a comprehensive annual audit mechanism encompassing both external and internal audits, successfully passing WebTrust audits for an impressive 16 consecutive years. To ensure compliance with audit engagement requirements, we conduct an annual auditor qualification review prior to engaging in the audit. Our compliance team engages in proactive communication with auditors regarding the audit period, scope, and expected report date, ensuring alignment with the latest WebTrust and browser requirements. Audit reports are promptly uploaded to CCADB and our official website. Additionally, we are preparing to launch the ETSI audit engagement starting in 2024, with ongoing communication with the auditor.

 

Internally, we have established the "Internal Audit Policy" and "Internal Audit Management Procedure" to define internal audit institutions and regulate the procedures for establishing, implementing, and reporting an internal audit plan. General control objectives, formulated by the Board-authorized general manager, guide the development of policies, procedures, standards, and work guidelines by respective business departments. Annual internal audit plans are crafted in line with the macro environment, company strategy, and operating objectives, ensuring a comprehensive company-wide internal audit of information security is conducted semi-annually. This process verifies the proper execution of the information security management strategy.

 

In accordance with with CCADB requirements, SHECA's compliance team conducts self-assessment annually and posts the self-assessment reports on CCADB.

## Q: How does your organization align with Apple's policy on privacy?

SHECA consistently acknowledges Apple's exemplary leadership in privacy protection and considers Apple as a role model. In line with this commitment, SHECA has instituted the "Personal Information Protection Management Rules." These rules articulate the objectives and principles governing the protection of personal data, outlining comprehensive regulations for the collection, use, retention, disposal, disclosure, and security control of personal information. Regular reviews by management ensure ongoing compliance with access, retention, disposal, transmission, disclosure, and security protection measures concerning personal information.

 

SHECA exclusively collects relevant personal information from registered customers with explicit authorization and active provision by the customers themselves. Prior to utilizing SHECA's services, customers are informed of the privacy policy within the subscriber agreement. Consent to the privacy policy is signed by customers on a voluntary basis and is a prerequisite for accessing the electronic identity authentication service.

 

For sensitive customer data and personal privacy data obtained from the Multi-source Authentication System of SHECA Identity Electronic Certification Service, SHECA employs an encryption storage mechanism. Encryption keys are securely stored in the identity authentication system's security module and must be accessed through this module. In the Letusign - Electronic Signature Business Module, sensitive data is encrypted and stored, with customers setting encryption keys that are hashed and stored in the database. Data transmission within SHECA's Identity Electronic Certification Service system is encrypted and digitally signed, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. The Letusign Electronic Signature Business Module utilizes encryption protocols for secure data transmission.

 

Data disposal procedures are activated under specific circumstances, including data owner requests (e.g., from clients and other subjects) and when data reaches its retention limit. SHECA management approval is mandatory before initiating data destruction. The process involves thorough formatting and logical destruction of the storage medium. If necessary, physical and chemical damage measures may be implemented on the storage medium. This meticulous approach ensures secure and responsible handling of personal data throughout its lifecycle.

## Q: Does your organization provide a current security policy to protect Apple users?

SHECA has implemented comprehensive security policies across all facets of its operations to safeguard Apple users. These policies cover Physical and Environmental Security, Operational Security, Information and Data Security, Development Security, Access Security, Threat and Vulnerability Management, Incident Management, and Business Continuity Management.

Responsibility for the custody and approval of our root keys lies with the Security Committee and Key Control Group. The Business Continuity Team oversees the approval and maintenance of the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and orchestrates its implementation. The Risk Control Team is tasked with conducting internal audits of company information security.

SHECA's "Personal Information Protection Policy" is transparently disclosed on the official website, allowing customers easy access to review it. Updates to the policy are promptly communicated on the official website whenever the privacy policy undergoes changes. In the event of a change in the use of personal information, SHECA ensures that customers are informed of the updated purpose in a clear and reasonable manner, seeking confirmation from customers.

In instances of personal information security incidents, SHECA promptly notifies affected customers and reports significant incidents to regulatory authorities in a timely fashion.

To underscore its commitment to robust security practices, SHECA has obtained international certifications such as ISO27001 and ISO9001. The organization pledges strict adherence to relevant regulations throughout the entire CA operation process, further solidifying its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of information security and compliance.

## Q: Does your organization keep user information private from third party vendors?

SHECA is steadfast in its adherence to local personal information protection laws and international regulations, including the PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law). Upholding user privacy, SHECA refrains from disclosing any user information to third parties without explicit authorization.

In alignment with our "Personal Information Protection Management Rules," we diligently seek consent from data subjects when the provision of personal information to third parties becomes necessary for business needs.

Prior to sharing data with third parties, a comprehensive background investigation is conducted to ensure the third party complies with data usage regulations. Agreements are established between SHECA and the third-party vendors, outlining the purpose of data usage, the delineation of rights and responsibilities, the scope of personal information transmitted, and confidentiality clauses. The Compliance Department plays a pivotal role in reviewing and validating these agreements, ensuring strict adherence to privacy and data protection standards.
